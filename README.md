Gives HTML tables awesome capabilities like column ordering, searching, and pagination.

The code was originally sourced from https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc.

Changes made:

- most features/options dropped in order to get to a manageable starting point
- Code modified to drop the jQuery dependency

Bear with me, I using this project to learn more about modern JavaScript.
